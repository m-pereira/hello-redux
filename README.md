# Hello Redux

A simple training app, based on an ecommerce, using Redux!

### Setup

* Run yarn install to install dependencies:

  $ `yarn install`

* This app was built, using a json-server api, then start that with:

  $ `yarn json-server server.json -p 3333 -w`

*3333 was used in services/api.js, and `-w` is for restart when file changes*

* Start react server:

  $ `yarn start`

Wait the server starts, and your browser will be opened with `localhost:3000`

That's it!
